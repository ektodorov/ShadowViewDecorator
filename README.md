# ShadowViewDecorator
Utility for Android to create shadows.

We can use it to just pass it views and it will asynchronously get their background and draw shadow around the view.<br>
We can use the Shadow View Decorator's utilities methods to draw shadow on a bitmap and have it returned to us.<br>
We can use it to create colored shadows/glows.<br>
With the second approach we can add to a view a StateListDrawable for different states of the view (pressed, selected, etc.).<br>
